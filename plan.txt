Plan of attack
1). Create nueral net with cell and compound type (one hot encoded)
as inputs and expression values as outputs. 
Use normalized outputs and remove controls.
2). Experiment with different models and with removing outliers
3). Figure out how to use SMILES data
4). Figure out how to control for location on plate 
5). Look into meta data??
